1 ADMISSIBILITY

I. The applicant and the respondent have standing to appear before the African Court.

II. The African Court has jurisdiction to hear the present matter.

III. All elements of the applicant's claim are admissible.
The question of admissibility of cases before the African Court has been criticised for being unclear (Ouguergouz The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (2003) 729.) and uncertain regarding the relationship between the African Court and the African Commission. Reference must be made to how the issue is dealt with under the African Charter, the African Court Protocol and the Merger of the African Courts Protocol and the Rules of Procedure of the African Court. This analysis seeks to determine the definite criteria of admissibility and where there are relevant issues to the present case that have not been dealt with, a comparison will be made to the criteria provided for the European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, to the extent that they align with the needs of the African context.
